## Welcome

I am a CS PhD candidate at Duke University, advised under Alex Hartemink, specializing in applied machine learning for biological time-series data. Most of my recent work sits in our [lab page](https://github.com/HarteminkLab).
I have ~8+ years developing scalable computational systems—from real-time mobile applications to advanced genomics frameworks.

## Research & Current Work
My research interests are in applying novel machine learning to interesting problems. For this reason, I've enjoyed working in the genomics space, where large amounts of data abound. These projects require detailed focus and an understanding of complex biological systems. These are challenging and rewarding problems.

Here are a few of my projects:
- [Temporal deconvolution for cell cycle chromatin analysis](https://github.com/HarteminkLab/cell-cycle-deconv/)
- [Vision transformer models for gene expression prediction](https://github.com/HarteminkLab/chromatin-transformers)
- [Chromatin and transcription dynamics under stress](https://github.com/HarteminkLab/cadmium-paper)

## Project samples
I am a visual learner. So, for many of my projects, creating clear figures are important. Below are a few samples.

### [Temporal deconvolution for cell cycle chromatin analysis](https://github.com/HarteminkLab/cell-cycle-deconv/)
A framework for deconvolving the cell cycle chromatin.

### [Vision transformer models for gene expression prediction](https://github.com/HarteminkLab/chromatin-transformers)
A vision transformer model to engineer features of the chromatin linked to gene expression. Below are learned attentions that describe which features are most informative for learning predictive features of the chromatin.
